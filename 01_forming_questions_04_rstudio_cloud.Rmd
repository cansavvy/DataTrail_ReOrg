# RStudio Cloud

The main software that we are going to use to analyze data in this class is called [R](https://www.r-project.org/). R is a piece of software that lets you write computer code to analyze data. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a company that makes a piece of software that works with R. RStudio makes it easier to create, save, share, and work with R code and data sets. R is one of the two most popular languages for data science. We will learn a lot more about it throughout the courses, but here we are just going to use it to take a peak at the data you have created.

If you have a more traditional laptop you can download and install R and RStudio on your laptop. But this class is part of our DataTrail program where we will be teaching you how to do everything through a web browser. Fortunately RStudio also offers a web-based version of their software called RStudio Cloud.

In a future class we will go into much more detail about RStudio and RStudio Cloud. For now, we will just go over the basics and then use RStudio Cloud to do a very basic analysis of the data you collected in your Google Sheet. Using RStudio Cloud we will give you all the commands you need to run to complete this project. Don't worry if this seems a little foreign, we are going to learn a lot more about it later! Just follow the steps and you'll end up with your very first plot!

### RStudio Cloud Basics

Before we get started with the data you collected, we'll explain the basic components of RStudio Cloud.

There are four main components in an RStudio Cloud window: the scripting area, the Console, the Environment, and the Files directory. We'll briefly discuss each part now and go into a lot more detail later.


![Four RStudio Cloud components](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY/export/png?id=1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY&pageid=g2df91c23aa_1_5)

First, in the top left-hand portion of the window, the scripting area is where you will see code to run in your first project in a few slides. In the future, this will be where you will type all your code. The code typed in this space can be saved and re-run later whenever you need it.


![Scripting RStudio Cloud](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY/export/png?id=1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY&pageid=g2df91c23aa_0_18)

In the bottom left-hand portion of the window is the Console. This is where the code you type in the scripting window above will actually run. You script what you want to happen in the scripting window. In the Console, what you wanted to happen actually happens.

The coding language R is an object-oriented programming language. This means that when you code, objects are created. We'll talk in detail about what that means later. However, any objects that you create while coding will be listed here in the Environment section in the top right-hand portion of the RStudio Cloud window.


![Environment RStudio Cloud](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY/export/png?id=1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY&pageid=g2df91c23aa_1_37)

The fourth component is at the bottom on the right-hand side of the window. Here, any files or folders you create, such as the scripts you save, will be listed.


![Files RStudio Cloud](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY/export/png?id=1FFaIAQO7qtUANdHApu4fFCcB0KT9FNo5oQCWLULqsdY&pageid=g2df91c23aa_1_30)

You'll also note that there are multiple tabs in each of these sections. We'll talk about the other tabs shortly; however, we'll note now that in the bottom right-hand section, there is a "Plots" tab. If you were to click on that you would simply see an empty blank space because you haven't made any plots yet. However, when you do the project you'll be generating a plot. The plot you create will show up in this tab.
