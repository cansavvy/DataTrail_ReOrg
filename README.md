## About this course

[DataTrail](https://www.datatrail.org/) is a no-cost, paid 14-week educational initiative for young-adult, high school and GED-graduates. DataTrail aims to equip members of underserved communities with the necessary skills and support required to work in the booming field of data science. 

DataTrail is a fresh take on workforce development that focuses on training both Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) interested in the data science industry and their potential employers.

Offered by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in partnership with local non-profits and Leanpub, DataTrail combines a mutually-intensive learning experience (MILE) with a whole-person ecosystem of support to allow aspiring data scientists and their employers to succeed.
