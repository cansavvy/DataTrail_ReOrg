# Stats Project

In each project, we'll aim to get you started and to ask questions that will help guide you through the project. But, we'll intentionally leave pieces out where you have to figure out what needs to be done.

This project will require you to:

* import data from the American Time Use Survey
* clean and tidy the data
* visualize the data
* carry out an exploratory data analysis
* carry out an inferential analysis

You can access the project by going to the exercise accompanying this lesson.
